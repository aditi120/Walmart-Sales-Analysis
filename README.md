# 🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting - Capstone Project

This project analyzes historical sales data from Walmart to uncover insights, understand sales patterns, and evaluate the impact of holidays on revenue. The goal is to identify trends and build a solid foundation for potential forecasting.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset consists of weekly sales data from various Walmart stores, capturing:
- Store-wise sales
- Weekly fluctuations
- Holiday vs. non-holiday impacts
- Promotions and markdowns

The project involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Group-wise aggregations
- Insights on holiday vs. non-holiday performance
